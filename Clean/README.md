# Base Game Template

Common starting point for C++ with Raylib implementation of Harvard CS50G projects.

## Dependencies

- RayLib (lib included in project files)

## How to run

```bash
# Cd into the Game directory
$ pwd
(/Path/To)/CS50gCpp/Game
$ make
$ ./build/main
```

I've set up a vscode workflow (included in `.vscode` files) such that you can build (`⌘⇧b`) and run (`f5` or `⌃f5`) without using the terminal.
