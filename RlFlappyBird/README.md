# CS50G Flappy Bird 

A C++ implementation of the [Harvard CS50G](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-game-development) interpretation of Flappy Bird 
([Lecture 1 on YoutTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IdOCxHGMIo))

## Dependencies

- RayLib (lib included in project files)

## How to run

```bash
# Cd into the RlFlappyBird directory
$ pwd
(/Path/To)/CS50gCpp/RlFlappyBird
$ make
$ ./build/main
```

I've set up a vscode workflow (included in `.vscode` files) such that you can build (`⌘⇧b`) and run (`f5` or `⌃f5`) without using the terminal.
